Data preprocessing is an important step in improving the quality of data for clustering algorithms. 
Some common techniques for data preprocessing include normalization, removing noisy data points, and feature reduction.

For example, if you’re using the K-means clustering algorithm, it’s important to ensure that your data meets certain 
requirements such as having numerical variables only, no noise or outliers, symmetric distribution of variables, variables on the same scale, 
no collinearity and few numbers of dimensions.

There are several ways to remove noisy data points from your dataset. 
One way is to use a clustering method to identify and remove noisy data points. 
This can be done at an early stage of data preprocessing, before normalizing your data, as normalizing your data can be affected by outliers.

Another way is to use smoothing techniques such as the Savitzky-Golay filter or Kalman filter to reduce noise in your data.
